# Objective

- The ultimate goal of this project is to develop an application that the Automotive Industry could use to harness data to make informed decisions. 
- It helps to find out which is the most popular car **on the basis** of its engine type, fuel type, mileage, model, etc. 
- It will help them to figure out the trending designs of cars and can use those reports to accordingly **manipulate the design of the cars**,by making them more      **optimized, customer-centric, and innovative**. 
- It also allows them to **find out the relation between** different parameters like how exactly the prices vary with the independent variables. With the help of **customer segmentation**, they can find which group of people prefers which features.

# Why this Project?

Quick and accurate analysis of data is something that cannot be neglected in the automotive industry. The scale of data that is available to us is huge and it is tedious to find out reports from it manually, also there are chances of making errors while calculating. All these complexities make the traditional quantitative approaches to analysis inappropriate.  This led to the need for the development of this application, with the help of Machine Learning concepts, we can easily **find out the variations of one feature with respect to others accurately in a very less time.**

# General Information about the Project

This project uses the concept of Data Analysis to demonstrate how the Automotive Industry could harness data to make informed decisions.

I have used this Dataset->[cars](https://github.com/Shweta2024/cars-engage-2022/blob/main/cars.csv)

- Since the given dataset had missing values, I deleted the columns having more than 60% missing values.

- Followed by filling the missing values with the mode of the column.

- Then, **I used plots such as** : bar plots, box plots, and scatter plots to display the relationship between different attributes(features of the cars).

- Followed by using an Elbow plot to find the optimal value of K to apply **K-Means Clustering** ,so as  to group the people on the basis of the Displacement and the Ex-Showroom Price

- Prior to using K-means Clustering, I scaled the values of Displacement and Ex-showroom Price, for making data points generalized so that the distance between them will be lower.

- This is an Elbow Plot and is used to find the optimal value of k ,for k-Means Clustering.
- Since the elbow is formed at k=3,therefore the optimal value of k is 3 .i.e. we'll have 3 clusters.

>Click on this link :- [Customer Segmentation](https://cars-engage-2022.herokuapp.com/optimalK)

The above link directs to the an interface where you can check the following information :-
- The head of the dataframe after scaling Displacement and Ex-Showroom Price.
- Elbow Plot(used to find the optimal value of k).
- Scatter plot between Displacement and Ex-Showroom Price (after using K-means clustering).


## Features

Below are the informations that can be found from my application :- 

- The most popular Car as per their Make , Model,Fuel Type ,Body Type, etc.
- How exactly the prices vary with the independent variables.
- Customer segments.





## Room for Improvement

- Since the aim of the project was to use data analysis,I have not used any algorithm to predict the price of a car.Although, algorithms like **Linear Regression** and  **Random Forest Algorithm** can be used for predicting the price of the car.
